# üé∂ Audio Equalizer Application  

An interactive **Audio Equalizer** built with **MATLAB App Designer**, featuring a graphical interface for real-time audio playback, filtering, and visualization. The project provides hands-on experience with **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** concepts by allowing users to adjust frequency bands, design FIR/IIR filters, and analyze signal behavior.

## ‚ú® Features  
- **Graphical User Interface**  
  Built with MATLAB App Designer, including playback controls, equalizer sliders, filter settings, and analysis tools.  

- **Filtering Options**  
  - FIR Filters: Hamming, Hanning, Blackman  
  - IIR Filters: Butterworth, Chebyshev I, Chebyshev II  
  - Adjustable filter orders  

- **Frequency Bands**  
  - Standard 9-band equalizer: *(0‚Äì200Hz, 200‚Äì500Hz, ‚Ä¶, 16‚Äì20kHz)*  
  - Custom mode: Define 5‚Äì10 user-defined bands spanning 0‚Äì20kHz  

- **Real-Time Control**  
  Vertical sliders for gain adjustments in dB with live playback updates.  

- **Analysis Tools**  
  Magnitude, phase, impulse, and step responses, plus pole-zero plots.  

- **Audio Processing**  
  - Change sampling rates (e.g., √ó4, √∑2)  
  - Export processed signals as new `.wav` files  
  - Compare original vs. filtered signals in time and frequency domains
